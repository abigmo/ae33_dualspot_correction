# ae33_dualspot_correction
Implementation of the Aethalometer AE33 Dual-spotÂ® correction (Drinovec et al., 2015) applied to MicroAethalometers MA200 (firmware v1.4).
The code is in R and it is provided as is.
It allows to compute the absorption corrected for loading at a custom time step, starting from the raw Attenuation provided by the instrument.

Ideally one can reconstruct also the Attenuation from the instrumental raw count.
